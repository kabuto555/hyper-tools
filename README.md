## Installation with contributing to HyperTools in mind:
1. Add the UniTask package: https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask?tab=readme-ov-file#upm-package
  - Or add the package by git url: `https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask.git?path=src/UniTask/Assets/Plugins/UniTask`
2. Add the Newtonsoft Json package by name: `com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json`
3. Add this repo as a submodule, in your Unity project Assets folder, preferably under `/Assets/HyperTools/`
